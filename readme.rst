Project Description
###################

The University of Aruba, the largest university caraîbes Islands, hosts more than 140 students in his classes.
In order to organize the trip to Quebec of all his students, eager to discover what may look like snow, the University would need to manage the 20 canoe-kayak which it is provided to them across the ocean .
Each boat holds 8 students maximum.

The director of the University of Aruba, 6 times world champion downhill skiing on boards of forged steel, described his dream interface in the following way:

"Easy to use interface that allows me to directly edit the names of students on the boat and reallocated a passenger ship in the middle of océano.También should be able to reserve a library-boat, so students can relax in groups maximum four students. it also requires that each ship can carry four pairs of skis forged steel (maximum). "

Using the model of data contained in the attached file (ArubaUniversity.zip) try to the best of your abilities to create a modern and useful interface for the director, using using any framework and / or tool you deem necessary .
It will have, if possible, be available in French and Spanish.
